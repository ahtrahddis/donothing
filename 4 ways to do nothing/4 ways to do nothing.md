# Silent Illumination (Chinese Chan)

## 1st Set of Instructions by Sheng Yen

*The following text is an excerpt from Sheng Yen's book ["The Method of No-Method"](https://www.shambhala.com/the-method-of-no-method-1029.html)*

Silent Illumination is another name for *shamata-vipashyana*, the meditative practice of stilling the mind and developing insight into its true nature. This practice originated in Indian Buddhism as early as the time of Shakyamuni Buddha. Traditionally, *shamata-vipashyana* was practiced sequentially. A practitioner progressed from *shamata* (stilling the mind) to *vipashyana* (insight, or illumination). The first stage was to practice *shamata* to achieve *samadhi* and then to practice *vipashyana* to achieve levels of insight. By contrast, in Chan Buddhism, which emphasizes the sudden approach to realization, *shamata* and *vipashyana* are practiced simultaneously.


### Relaxing Mind and Body

To enter the practice you need to do just two things: relax your body and relax your mind. First, make sure that all parts of your body are completely relaxed and at ease. Next, relax your attitude and your mood; make sure that your mental attitude, the tone of your approach, and your mood are also at ease. This relaxation is the foundation for success in practicing Silent Illumination. Now I would like all of you to try to relax your body and mind. I will guide you as we relax parts of our body together.

Begin with a comfortable sitting posture. Let’s start with your head. Please make sure that each part of this region is relaxed. Relax your face; now relax your eyes. Are they relaxed? Proceed downward to relax your cheeks, down to your neck and your shoulders. Are they relaxed? Continue down your arms and then the hands. Make sure that they are relaxed. Follow with the chest, and now the back, which should be upright yet relaxed. Please make sure that the muscles of your abdomen are relaxed; this is very important.

Once these exercises are completed, there should be three points making contact with your cushion and mat—your buttocks and your two knees. Only these three points should feel your weight and ground you to the floor as your whole body relaxes from head to toe. The rest of your body should also be completely relaxed.

After doing these exercises, if you still feel that you are not sufficiently relaxed, please do it again by yourself. From the top, relax part by part, all the way down to your feet. Mentally sweep down your body, part by part, and relax each region; do this as often as you need in order to feel relaxed.


### Entering the Practice of Silent Illumination

Once you have relaxed your body, notice that your bodily weight has settled downward. Proceed to simply being aware of yourself sitting there and put your total awareness on your body sitting there. If you are relaxed and you have focused your awareness on yourself just sitting there, you have already entered the practice of Silent Illumination! However, this is just the beginning.

If you cannot relax your eyes by maintaining them slightly open, you may close them. If you keep your eyes open, do not look at anything; just keep them slightly open, gazing down at about a 45-degree angle. If your eyes are tense, your head region will become tense; if your eyes are relaxed, you will find that your head region is also relaxed.

If you have wandering or discursive thoughts, you may open your eyes slightly. If you find yourself becoming drowsy, it is a sign that you are not relaxed. If you are completely relaxed and are aware of your body just sitting there, then you won’t be drowsy. Drowsiness results when you are not using your method properly, either not being relaxed or not putting your mind on just sitting. It may be you have already given up on your method. Or you may be sitting but not practicing, just resting. This form of resting while sitting may lead to laziness and idleness.


### Just Sitting

If you are clear that you are relaxed or prompting yourself to relax, that itself is a method. This process will expand into becoming clear and aware that you are just sitting there. This is not merely checking the parts of your body; it is also awareness through sensing the presence of your body sitting there. This is the meaning of “just sitting.” In just sitting, you keep your awareness on the total sensation of your body sitting there. Stay with the totality of that awareness; do not become caught up in any particulars. Being aware of the particulars of the body is practicing mindfulness, but we are not practicing mindfulness; we are practicing Silent Illumination. Remember also that you are not practicing mindfulness of breath. Breath is certainly a sensation, but it is merely a part of your total body sensation. You are practicing being aware of the whole body just sitting there with all its different sensations as a totality. Do not become caught up in these various sensations. Just maintain the totality of the sensations of your body just sitting. It is impossible to be aware of every part of the body sitting there. Just be aware of those parts that impinge on your senses. You do not need to be aware of the parts of the body that you cannot sense, such as internal organs. Just take the parts of the body as a whole. The key is to constantly maintain this knowing and awareness of the totality of your body.

For the first two days of the retreat, it will be natural if most of your bodily awareness is discomfort, but do not add any thoughts, feelings, or attitudes on top of that. There may be particular parts of the body experiencing pain or even pleasure, but do not localize or focus on those parts. Keep them in the context of the whole body sitting there. Just acknowledge that there is pain or comfort at this moment, and maintain a simple knowing and recognition of that in your total-body sensation.

Tension in certain areas of the body can cause the whole body to become unsettled or agitated. If this happens, please return to the relaxation method. Just mentally sweep your body part by part until you are relaxed, at ease, and stable. When you have done this, just sit in awareness.

### Extending Practice to Life Habits

You can also integrate these principles into all your activities. Just as when you sit in meditation you just sit, when you sleep, be aware of the totality of your whole being going to sleep. When walking, you just walk. When you eat, you are right there just eating. Plunge your whole life into what you are doing at that very moment and live that way. So we train ourselves to engage our whole being in what we are doing. Whether sitting or eating, you are not engaged in discursive, wandering, or deluded thoughts. All of you—environment, body, and mind—is right there. Whatever you do, whatever the task at hand, your whole life is there at that moment.

Some people may interpret plunging your whole being into the practice or into the task at hand as a very tense approach. This is incorrect. By putting your whole being into whatever you are doing, you are also being relieved from doing anything else at that moment. Therefore, when you are doing that one thing, that is all you have to care about, and you can do it in a very relaxed manner and attitude. In this light, you will better understand the meaning of engaging your whole being in the present task. This is the relaxed and reposed attitude to practice.



## 2nd Set of Instructions by Sheng Yen

*Following is a transcript from a lecture given by Master Sheng-yen during a 1993 Ch’an retreat, edited by Linda Peer and Harry Miller.*

**Shikantaza and Silent Illumination**

The Japanese term *“shikantaza”* literally means *“just sitting”.* Its original Chinese name, mo-chao, means *“silent illumination”.* “Silent” refers to not using any specific method of meditation and having no thoughts in your mind. “Illumination” means clarity. You are very clear about the state of your body and mind.

When the method of silent illumination was taken to Japan it was changed somewhat. The name given to it, *“just sitting”*, means just paying attention to sitting or just keeping the physical posture of sitting, and this was the new emphasis. The word *“silent”* was removed from the name of the method and the understanding that the mind should be clear and have no thoughts was not emphasized. In silent illumination, *“just sitting”* is only the first step. While you maintain the sitting posture, you should also try to establish the “silent” state of the mind. Eventually you reach a point where the mind does not move and yet is very clear. That unmoving mind is *“silent”*, and that clarity of mind is *“illumination”*. This is the meaning of *“silent illumination”.*

Faith in Mind, a poem attributed to the Third Patriarch of Ch’an, Seng-Ts’an (d. 606), begins with something like this: *“The highest path is not difficult, so long as you are free of discriminations”.* “Discriminations” can also be translated as “choices”, “selections”, or “preferences”. The highest path is not difficult, if you are free from choosing, selecting or preferring. You must keep the mind free from discrimination and attachment. The method in which the mind is kept free from discrimination and attachment is what is called *“silence”* here. But *“silent”* does not mean the mind is blank and cannot function. The mind is free from attachment, clear, and yet it still functions.

We also read in Faith in Mind that, *“This principle is neither hurried nor slow. One thought for ten thousand years”.* *“This principle”* is the mind of wisdom, and from its perspective time does not pass quickly or slowly. When we meditate or work, we may fall into a worldly samadhi state and feel that time passes very quickly. In an ordinary state we may feel that time passes quickly or slowly. However, in the mind of wisdom there is no such thing as slow or hurried time. If we can say there is thought in the mind of wisdom, it is an endless thought which never changes. This unchanging thought is no longer thought as we usually understand it. It is the unmoving mind of wisdom.

In the Song of Samatha of Master Yung-chia Hsuan-chueh (665 – 713, also the author of the Song of Enlightenment), two Chinese terms are used which can be translated as *“quiescence”* and *“clarity”.* Master Yung-chia uses them in two phrases, *“quiescence and clarity”*, and *“clarity and quiescence”*. They describe a person whose mind is both clear and unmoving. When an ordinary person’s mind is clear and alert, it is usually also active and full of scattered thoughts. Quiescence of mind is difficult to maintain. When the mind is quiet, it usually is not clear, even in a samadhi state. But Yung-chia describes these two states, quiescence and clarity as well as clarity and quiescence, as goals.

Master Hung-chi Chen-chueh (1091-1157), who invented the term “silent illumination” in his poem the Song of Silent Illumination, said this:


*In silence, words are forgotten.*<br>
*In utter clarity, things appear.*

*“Words are forgotten”* means you experience no words, no language, no ideas, and no thought. There is no discrimination. This in combination with the second phrase, *“In utter clarity everything appears”*, means that although words, language and discrimination do not function, everything is still seen, heard, tasted and so on.

Someone told me that when he uses the Silent Illumination method, he eventually gets to a point where there is nothing there and he rests. That is not true Silent Illumination. In Silent Illumination everything is there, but the mind is not moving. A person may think he has no thoughts because the coarser wandering thoughts are absent, but there will be fine, subtle wandering thoughts of which he is unaware. He may think there is nothing there and so stop practicing. In Chinese this is called *“Being on the dark side of a mountain in a cave inhabited by ghosts”.* The mountain is dark, so there is nothing to see, and in the cave of ghosts, what can one accomplish?

Now I would like to explain how to use the method of shikantaza. First, your posture should be upright. Do not lean in any direction. Be clear about your posture, because if you practice shikantaza, just sitting, at the very least you should be conscientious about sitting. It is also important to remain relaxed.

Next, be aware of your body, but do not think of it as yourself. Regard your body as a car you drive. You have to handle the car well, but it is not you. If you think of your body as yourself, you will be bothered by pain, itchiness and other vexations. Just take care of the body and be aware of it. The Chinese name for this method can be translated as “just take care of sitting.” You have to be mindful of your body as the driver must be mindful of the car, but the car is not the driver.

After a period of time, the body will sit naturally and cause no problems. Now you can begin to pay attention to the mind. If you were eating, your mind should be the “mind of eating,” and you would pay attention to that mind. When you are sitting, your mind should be the “mind of sitting.” You watch this sitting mind. Two different thoughts alternate: the mind of sitting and the mind, or thought, that watches the mind of sitting. First you watch the body sitting with little attention to the mind. When the body drops away, watch the mind. What is the mind? It is the mind of sitting! When your attention dissipates, you will lose awareness of this sitting mind and the sensations of the body will return. Then you should again watch the body sitting. Another possibility is that while you watch the mind you fall into a dull state, like *“Being on the dark side of the mountain in a cave inhabited by ghosts”*. When you become aware of this situation, your bodily sensations return, and you should go back to watching them. Thus these two objects of attention, the body and the mind, are also used alternately.

In the state where you watch the mind, are you aware of the external environment, sound for example? If you want to hear sound, you will, and if you do not want to hear sound, you won’t. At this point, you primarily pay attention to your own mind. Although you may hear sounds, they do not create discriminations.

There are three stages in this practice. You should start at the beginning and progress to deeper levels. First be mindful of your body. Then be mindful of your mind, and of the two thoughts alternating in it. The third stage is enlightenment. The mind is clear and, as the poem quoted said, “*In silence, words are forgotten. In utter clarity, things appear”*. When you first practice, you will probably be in the first or second level. If you use this method correctly you will not enter into samadhi.

This last point needs clarification. It depends on how we use the term *“samadhi”*. In Buddhadharma, samadhi has many meanings. For instance, Sakyamuni Buddha was always in samadhi. His mind was not moving, yet he still continued to function. This is wisdom. Sakyamuni Buddha’s samadhi is great samadhi and this is the same as wisdom. When I said that in the practice of Silent Illumination, you should not enter samadhi, I meant worldly samadhi where you forget about space and time and are oblivious to the environment. The deeper kind of samadhi, which is the same as wisdom, is in fact the goal of Silent Illumination.

What good is this explanation of Silent Illumination for people who are not using this method? If you are using another method of practice and you reach a point where it is impossible to continue, you can switch to Silent Illumination and watch your body and mind. For instance, if you use the method of reciting Buddha’s name with counting and you can no longer count, switch to Silent Illumination. If you use the hua-t’ou method, but find that rather than generating great doubt, you are simply repeating your hua-tou, you may reach a point where you can no longer recite it. You can then switch to Silent Illumination and watch your body and mind. Eventually, you will be able to use your own method again. Silent Illumination can provide a continuum for you in this in-between state so that you do not waste time.

I was just asked whether the enlightenment that comes from Silent Illumination is sudden or gradual. Enlightenment is always instantaneous. It is the practice that is gradual. As I mentioned earlier, the third level of Silent Illumination is enlightenment. But how does one get there? As you practice, your attachments, discriminations, and wandering thoughts gradually subside. Eventually, you simply have no discriminations, but this change is instantaneous. When the change happens, you are in the state Hung-chi Cheng-chueh described as, “In silence, words are forgotten. In utter clarity, everything appears".

After you have some experience practicing, the sentiments and vexations you ordinarily experience may not arise during practice. It does not mean that they are gone. It just means that when you practice they do not arise. When you use Silent Illumination, this may happen, especially at the second level, but that is not enlightenment. Practice is not like trying to clear thoughts from your mind and vexations from your life as if they were dust on a mirror. You cannot wipe the dust away and make yourself enlightened. It is not like that. Whether you use the methods of the Lin-chi or Tsao-tung sects within the Ch’an tradition, once enlightened, you realize that enlightenment has nothing to do with the practice that brought you there.

So why bother to practice? Practice is like a bridge that can lead to enlightenment, even though enlightenment has nothing to do with practice.


# Zazen (Soto Zen Shikantaza)

## Instructions by Shohaku Okumura

*The following is a written record of a zazen instruction class given by Shohaku Okumura to a group of students. Okumura Roshi has been sitting zazen for over 35 years and is an acclaimed Zen Buddhist teacher, translator and author. He is the head priest and founder of Sanshin Zen Community located in Bloomington, Indiana.*


There are many traditions of Buddhism, and each tradition has its
own approach to meditation practice. My practice was developed
within the Japanese Soto Zen tradition, so what I will tell you
about meditation is only from the perspective of that tradition. If
you think my style of practice is not for you, you do not have to think
that all types of meditation are not for you; there exist many other
methods of meditation and spiritual paths that you can explore
besides the one I will present to you.

In our tradition we call this meditation zazen. In Japanese za means
“sitting” and zen means “meditation”. There are three important
points of practice in sitting meditation. The first one is harmonizing
the body, the second is harmonizing the breath, and the third is
harmonizing the mind. Body, breath, and mind are the three most
important points of practice in meditation.

### The Body

First I will explain how to harmonize the body. In almost
all Buddhist traditions one sits in a cross-legged posture during
meditation. If you are able to sit in a cross-legged position during
zazen that is fine, but if it that is too painful for you it is alright, too;
sitting cross-legged is not strictly necessary for meditation. For the
half-lotus position, put either foot on top of the opposite thigh, and place the other foot on the floor underneath the other thigh. Please
make sure that both knees are on the floor because this makes the
posture stable. If possible, put each foot on the opposite thigh with the
line of the toes matching the outer line of the thighs. This is called
the full lotus position and it is the most balanced and stable posture
because the weight of the body, like a teapot’s, is supported at three
points: the two knees and the buttocks. This is the most stable position
for sitting, though “most stable” does not mean “most comfortable” for
many people. Sit in full lotus if you are able, but if that is too painful
you may also sit in half lotus, with just one foot on the opposite thigh.
Another sitting position you can use is called Burmese; in this position
you put both feet on the floor. But still the important point is that
both of the knees are on the floor. So whether in Burmese, half lotus,
or full lotus, the important point is to make a solid stable foundation
with the knees and buttocks that supports the upper part of the body.

If these cross-legged positions are difficult for you, you may wish to
sit in the posture called *seiza*. In this posture you sit with both knees
straight in front of your body and the buttocks rests on a cushion
with the feet on either side of it. Seiza is the posture traditionally
used in Japan for regular sitting in daily life. If that posture is too
uncomfortable you can use a meditation bench or a chair.

After crossing your legs (if you are sitting in a cross-legged posture)
and before adjusting your posture, sway your body several times from
left to right, starting with a large movement that gradually decreases
in size. We do this is to relax the muscles. Lean the upper body
forward while keeping the legs in place, and return the torso to center
without moving your lower back. This will create a natural curvature
in the lower back. Then pull your chin in so your neck is straight. You
should feel as if the top of your head and the center of your buttocks
are within the same vertical line. The horizontal line connecting your
ears and the horizontal line connecting your shoulders should be
parallel, and the vertical line connecting your nose and belly should
be straight. The important point of this posture is to keep the body
upright and well balanced; try not to lean in any direction, neither right nor left, neither forward nor backward. If your body is not
straight your back will be bent and sitting for a long time will create
pain at the point where the spine is bent. It is important to find a
natural position for yourself in sitting. The body should be thoroughly
straight, yet the muscles should be relaxed, not tense. Finally, when
your posture becomes really upright, be still, take in one deep breath
through your nose, and then exhale completely through your mouth to
help you really settle into the posture. Adopting this posture is how we
harmonize the body.

When we sit we keep the eyes open. In some traditions the eyes
are closed in meditation, but in our tradition we keep the eyes open.
Direct your vision about three feet in front of your body, and your eyes
will naturally come to rest in position that is half opened and half
closed. When doing zazen in the meditation hall, we sit facing the
wall. Try not to focus on anything; just keep your eyes open without
directing your gaze on any particular object.

Next I will explain how to hold your hands in zazen. First put the
top of your right hand on the palm of your left hand, overlapping
the fingers. Now make an oval by touching the tips of the thumbs
together at about the height of your navel. This is called the cosmic
*mudra*. In this position the right hand and the left hand, the two
sides, come together and become one. This is the meaning of the
*mudra*; it is beyond duality, just as the body becomes truly one thing
in zazen. If you place your hands too low or too high in making the
*mudra*, you may experience tension in your shoulders or neck. It is
therefore important to find the best height to hold the *mudra* for your
particular body. If you find it helpful, you can put a towel on your lap
and place your hands on it. In the same fashion, some practitioners
that wear robes with big sleeves arrange those sleeves on their laps
as a foundation for the *mudra*. When we see the shape of our hands in
zazen as we make the *mudra*, we can see the condition of our minds. If
your mind is somewhere else when you sit, naturally the shape of this
oval becomes distorted. As a way to stay mindful, attempt to keep the
hands stable with the *mudra* in tact.

In review, the important point is to make a stable foundation for
zazen with the lower half of your body. Also, keep the back straight,
lower your eyesight three feet in front of your body, and hold your
hands in the cosmic *mudra*. This is how we sit in zazen.

### The Breath

Next I will explain how to breathe in zazen; breathing is one of the
most important points in any kind of meditation practice. When your
posture is stable, first exhale from the mouth completely, letting the air
inside your body completely out. When you have completely exhaled,
you close your mouth, place your tongue on the roof of you mouth, and
inhale through your nose. When you do this, you will feel the fresh air
come in through your nose. Also, when you sit in meditation, breathe
abdominally. Keeping your tongue on the roof of your mouth, breathe
easily and naturally with the air coming into your body through your
nose and down to your abdomen. When we breathe in this way, the
belly moves as the air comes in and as it goes out. Keep the breath deep,
smooth, and peaceful. It is best if the exhalation is longer than the
inhalation in zazen. Just slowly and completely exhale all of the air, and
then air will naturally come back into your lungs. It is not necessary
to make any special effort to regulate your breathing; just keep
breathing naturally through the nose, so naturally that you forget about
breathing. In some traditions, sometimes even in the Zen tradition,
some teachers teach the meditation technique of counting the breath.
In this method the practitioner counts the breaths from one to ten,
repeating the count over again after each series of ten breaths. Some
teachers also teach watching the breath­ ­– paying special attention to
the air as it comes in and goes out of the body. In my tradition we don’t
count or watch the breath, we just breathe naturally, deeply and quietly.

### The Mind

Of course even when we sit breathing quietly in this posture many
things happen within the mind. In zazen we simply allow any thought,
feeling or emotion to come up and then we simply let them go away;
we actually do nothing. In sitting, any thought or condition of mind
is like a cloud in the sky. Somehow clouds appear in the sky, changing
form as they stay for a while, and then they disappear. Similar to clouds
in the sky, any thought that appears in zazen simply stays for a while and then disappears. I have been practicing this style of meditation for
more than 35 years, and in my experience, no thought stays in the mind
forever. Everything is coming and going, and we just let things come
up freely and let them go away freely. We don’t try to fight against our
thoughts or any other mental condition, and we don’t try to interact
with them, either. The intention is not to grasp what is coming up from
your consciousness. We actually do nothing but let the things happening
within the mind just flow. Yet when you become aware that you are
interacting with what is happening in your mind, just stop interacting
and return to the zazen posture while breathing with the eyes open.
That means you let go of whatever thoughts come up, and you also don’t
sleep. This is the point in our sitting practice.

Yet if you try to sit in this way for just ten minutes, you will find it
is really difficult. It is difficult for even ten minutes to continually keep
this upright posture, keep your eyes open without focusing on anything,
and keep letting go of whatever arises in your mind. It is exceedingly
difficult to do nothing, and zazen is essentially doing nothing but
sitting. The founder of our tradition, Zen master Eihei Dogen, called
this practice *shikantaza*. Shikantaza means “just sitting” in Japanese,
and to just sit means that we really only sit without doing anything
else. This is a really simple practice; we do nothing but sit in the zazen
posture breathing easily, keeping the eyes open, staying awake, and
letting go. That’s all we do in zazen; we do nothing else. Yet even if you
try to sit just five minutes in this way you will find it really difficult.
This practice is very simple but simple does not necessarily mean easy.
So whenever we become aware that we have deviated from that point
of upright posture, deep breathing, keeping the eyes open without
focusing, and letting go of whatever comes up, we try to return to that
point. In whatever condition we find ourselves in, we just return to
posture, breathing, waking up, and letting go. That is what we do in
meditation.

When we begin and when we finish zazen we do *gassho*. To do *gassho*
is to put both hands together, at chest height, and bow. This expresses
respect, friendship and gratitude. 

At the end of a period of meditation, unfold your legs and notice
how they feel before you get up. If your legs have fallen asleep, take
your time standing up until you feel comfortable doing so.

When we sit more than one period of zazen, between periods we do
a walking meditation for ten minutes that is called *kinhin* in Japanese.

### Some questions given by those receiving zazen instruction: 

***How long do you usually sit?***

In our zendo we sit two 50-minute periods in the early morning, with
ten minutes of walking meditation between periods. We usually sit
from 5AM to 7AM six days a week. But five times a year we have a kind
of a intensive retreat called *sesshin*. During sesshin we sit fourteen of
these 50-minute periods a day, from 4 in the morning until 9 in the
evening, for five days. There is a short break after each of the three
meals, but other than that we just keep repeating the periods of sitting
and walking meditation fourteen times a day. It is very quiet, and for
some people it is very boring.

***What do you notice changes in your life after practicing?***

When I started practicing I was nineteen years old, so I don’t really
know what difference the practice has made. Everything was changing
in my life as I was growing as teenager and becoming an adult. I
changed a lot, but I don’t know whether this change was a result of
my meditation practice or a result of something else, so I cannot really
tell you. I will tell you a very famous saying of my teacher’s teacher,
Kodo Sawaki-roshi. He said that zazen is good for nothing. I hope you
like that statement.

***As one progresses in their practice how does their awareness change?***

Awareness? Well in our practice the point of sitting is being right
here, right now. Often, though we are sitting in the zazen posture, in
that moment of sitting the mind is somewhere else. Being mindful means that both the body and the mind are present right here, right
now. Our practice is returning to this moment, right now, right here,
with both the body and the mind. Depth or progress of awareness is
not important in our practice. Depending upon the age of the person
and how long he or she has been sitting, of course, mental conditions
are different, but that is not important in our practice. In our practice
the most important point is being fully present, right now, right here.
That’s all. So our goal is coming back to this moment, to this place.

***In the process of doing meditation do you notice special things in your mind?***

Like what you can see because you meditate, something beyond just thoughts?
When we sit for long periods of time, of course we experience all
different kinds of mental conditions. Sometimes we experience some
really weird things, or sometimes it seems as if we are in a daydream.
Sometimes, especially when first beginning this sitting practice, we
struggle with pain. Sometimes we may be extremely sleepy, and sleeping
in this posture is something very different from sleeping in a bed. This
is because when we are sitting zazen we try to stay awake when we
are sleepy, though the body wants to sleep. This is a struggle between
body and mind. The depths of sleepiness and awakening vary a lot.
Sometimes we are one hundred percent sleeping, sitting in this posture.
Sometimes we are half-awake and half-asleep; other times we are very
awake. Within this sleepiness we experience many different kinds of
mental conditions. So it may be dangerous if we interpret any particular
mental condition as enlightenment. Sometimes this world becomes
very bright, and sometimes a person may feel he or she understands
everything. It may seem at this time that there is no doubt or question
remaining about anything; everything is okay as it is. But that is just
a condition arising from the states of the body, mind, temperature,
humidity and all other conditions of our lives. These conditions are not
the important point of our practice. Our practice is to keep an upright
posture in any condition; we just go through all conditions. As I said
earlier, the conditions of our minds while sitting are like clouds in the
sky. Sometimes we have no clouds at all with a completely blue sky, and this is very beautiful. More often we have different kinds of clouds
coming and going. Sometimes more than half of the sky is covered with
clouds, and sometimes the entire sky is completely covered with clouds,
or even storms arise. There are many different kinds of conditions we
must sit through in zazen, but the purpose of our practice does not include
controlling the weather. The important point is to maintain this upright
posture in whatever conditions we encounter. To do so we need a kind of
faith. We must live beneath the clouds, but above the clouds the sun is
always shining and the sky is always blue. We cannot live up in the sky; we
must to go through all the different conditions of weather we encounter.
The important point is to maintain this upright posture and go through all
conditions.

***How does getting rid of attachment effect your lifestyle? Do you try to live very frugally
or how does it effect your day to day life?***

Being free from attachment is a very important point in all Buddhist
teachings. When we sit zazen, many different kinds of thoughts come up.
We may think some thoughts are really good ideas, yet in zazen we have to
let go of them; we open the hand of thought. Whether we like our ideas or
whether we experience negative feelings about something, we try to let go
because that is zazen. I think this letting go is the way we are free from our
clinging, our preferences, our systems of value, and our ways of thinking.
This zazen itself is freedom from attachment.

# Pristine Mind (Dzogchen)

## Set of Instructions by Orgyen Chowang

*The following text is an excerpt from Orgyen Chowang's book ["Our Pristine Mind"](https://pristinemind.org/our-pristine-mind/).*

Each time we meditate, whether for realizing Pristine Mind or journeying deeper into Pristine Mind, we need to follow the same techniques. When we first realize our true nature, we use these techniques, and when we are abiding in our true nature, we also use these techniques. Whether we are just entering meditation or pursuing the experience of Pristine Mind all the way through to enlightenment, we must use the same four instructions that follow below.

In preparation, sit anywhere comfortable, such as a cushion or a chair, and relax your body. As mentioned earlier, this is always the first step to meditation. It does not matter where you sit, as long as you are comfortable. Relax your body. Make sure that there are no uncomfortable sensations or tensions in your body. Keep your eyes open. Silence your voice. Rest your speech, let yourself be quiet, and breathe in a very natural and relaxed way.

“Relaxing” does not mean we go limp and drowsy. Instead, our body and mind are alert and awake. We are relaxing from stress but not dulling ourselves or abandoning our awareness and succumbing to sleepiness or mindless daydreams. According to a well-known saying of the Buddha, we should be neither too taut nor too loose, like the well-tuned strings of a musical instrument. We are actively focused and alert. We are even enthusiastic about what we are doing.

While we remain alert, we allow our mind to be mentally, emotionally, and spiritually calm. We let go of any internal chatter by allowing all mental and emotional dialogue to subside. We do not try to engage in any thoughts or emotions. We just abide in alert awareness; we are conscious of our awareness. This is the preparation that we need for the true experience of meditation.

To continue to uncover our pristine, clear, calm state of mind, we need to orient our meditation around the four steps introduced by Guru Rinpoche Padmasambhava.

First, Guru Rinpoche Padmasambhava says, *Don’t follow the past.*

We should not begin to wander in the direction of memories, thoughts, emotions, and images associated with the past. Instead, bring your mind into the present. The more easily and fully we arrive at the present moment, the more of our meditation time can be spent in the experience of Pristine Mind. Our ordinary mind makes it very difficult to stay in the present moment. One way it does this is by taking us back to the past. When we are fully in the present, we are prepared to journey into Pristine Mind.

Second, Guru Rinpoche says, *Don’t anticipate the future*.

Do not let your mind begin to wander in the direction of future concerns and plans. If it does go in that direction, simply return to the present moment. We need not be concerned about anything in the future right now because at this moment, we are doing meditation. Meditation takes place in the present moment where Pristine Mind is experienced.

If we follow these first two steps, our mind is no longer caught up in the past or in the future. Most mental events, most negative thoughts and emotions, most things that disturb us, most unhappiness and sadness, come from focusing on the past or future. To clear these mental events before they even start, we need to release our focus on the past and future during meditation. We just bring our mind into the present moment.

The third step, Guru Rinpoche says, is, *Remain in the present moment.*

Just be present. Remain fully and vividly present.

Being present is an active process. It is a journey into an increased awareness of the present. We are not preoccupied with the past or the future because they take us away from this active focus on our own present awareness. We actively participate in that journey by focusing on our actual present awareness itself, all the while staying awake and aware. When we do that more and more successfully over a sufficient period of time, we begin to connect with our Pristine Mind, which is inherently present, here and now. This is not a passive experience in which we let our mind either lapse into dullness or run amok with thoughts and feelings. It is something we energetically pursue with great motivation and enthusiasm.

The fourth and final step in Guru Rinpoche’s instructions is, *Leave your mind alone*.

Once we are fully present, what do we do with our mind? There is nothing to do with it. Just leave your mind alone. We continue to remain in the present moment, as we have described above. Be present and leave your mind alone without fabricating, without elaborating in any way; simply remain in that state. Just as we can leave our hand alone, we can leave our mind alone. If we leave our hand alone, we are not shaking it, making gestures, twiddling our thumbs, or lifting a cup. Leaving our hand alone means not doing anything with it. Just leave it there. Similarly, leaving our mind alone is not engaging in thoughts, emotions, memories, or future plans. Just leave it there so that we can be in the meditation experience.

After we follow these steps for five minutes or so, then true Pristine Mind meditation experience can begin. Once we have consciously remained in the present moment and left our mind alone for a few minutes, our mental events, our internal dialogue, our thoughts and emotions, all slowly subside. They subside because they cannot continue when we leave our mind alone. Mental events need an object to survive; the more we are present, the more our mental events subside. We have fewer and fewer overpowering mental events and swirling, stormy emotions. When we are fully present, when we completely leave our mind alone, all mental events subside.

When our mental events subside, what is left? What remains when emotions, thoughts, and belief systems dissolve? What is left is pure consciousness, pure awareness, Pristine Mind without layers, without distortions, and without obscurations. There is no mental or emotional pollution in that moment because it all subsides during each moment that we spend in the natural state of mind. Pristine Mind surfaces, and we experience it directly.

Once we experience that pristine state of mind, we simply stay there. We become familiar with it and abide in it as much as we can. This is meditation. Other than being who we really are, being in our pristine state of mind, there is nothing to meditate “on.” While our pristine fundamental consciousness is innately present, it is meditation that reveals it. It is our meditation that lets us become familiar with it, familiar enough that one day it will be the way we naturally are, even without meditation.

That’s what meditation is: in meditation we are actually remaining in Pristine Mind; we are not meditating on anything. Once we are in Pristine Mind, we just remain in it and continue the journey. We continue to not get caught up in mental events, not get caught up in the past or future. We develop intimacy with our natural state of mind.

There are no thoughts or emotions or other mental events to entertain in this state. It is much more comfortable than our ordinary state of mind. There are no ups and downs, no mood swings, and no good or bad states. It is clear like the blue sky. It is not like taking a nap or resting temporarily to get away from the turbulence of ordinary mind. Meditation provides much, much more for those who understand it and practice it.

### Leave Your Mind Alone

In his instructions for resting the mind, Guru Rinpoche Padmasambhava says, “Leave your mind alone.” In meditation we should have no fabrications, no resistance, no wandering, and no concern. Just leave your mind to be the way mind is naturally—calm and clear like water.

When there is too much going on in our mind, when our mind is distracted, unhappy, or stressed, if we are moody or agitated, what we need to do is leave our mind alone. At those times our mind is like water that has dust and debris stirred up in it. We must let the dust and debris settle to return to the calm and tranquil state that is actually inherent to our natural condition. When we do, the agitation, despair, and fatigue evaporate like a mirage when we approach it.

How do we clarify murky water? We don’t shake it. We don’t stir it. The best way to clear the water is just to leave it alone. Let it settle, and the water will naturally clarify itself. The water slowly regains its transparency after all the dust settles.

In the same way, when our mind is cloudy, unhappy, or agitated, the best way to improve it is to leave it alone and let it settle. Once we return to the present moment, there are no more mental elaborations; there are no mental contrivances, no judgments of any kind. Once we just leave our mind alone, then all these distortions and agitations settle down and the mind slowly regains its calm, clear, boundless state. A happy, clear, open state comes to the surface.

Leave your mind alone. So often, we mess with our mind and let ourselves be swept away by its troubled states. That’s why we are so stressed and fearful much of the time. The working of our ordinary mind, which we tend to take as a given, is the origin of so many of these feelings, the mental junk and garbage that we call suffering. It does not have to be that way. Pristine Mind meditation is the highway to the essence of our nature, which is pristine and changeless.

Sometimes we may think, “I’m not doing anything to make problems for myself. I’m just stressed out.” We don’t think we are contributing to the cause of these feelings. We think we are just unhappy, stressed, or angry. We believe we are innocent bystanders to our experience, but that is not true. The mind is constantly creating the very suffering that we think we have nothing to do with. We may be sitting on the couch, seemingly passive, but actively thinking, “He did this. She is doing that. I don’t like any of it. How did this happen?” Internally, an enormous amount is happening. We are pondering so many situations and dwelling on so many problems. We think this is all an involuntary and inevitable response to life, but leaving our mind alone is really all we need to do to release all stresses and other mental agitations. We do not need any other antidote. We need nothing but our awareness of the present moment of our Pristine Mind.

What is most important to understand here is that any fixation, fretting, or lingering is a form of messing with our own mind. What we need to do is remain in the present moment and not manipulate our mind in any way. Then our mind naturally becomes more clear and relaxed without our having to do anything. This all happens automatically. Our mind naturally becomes clear and pristine—calm, clear, and boundless.

How do we treat our mind properly? “Leave your mind alone.” All disturbances and agitations come from not leaving our mind alone. Therefore, the way to resolve these problems is to leave the mind alone. That is the most natural way to prevent disturbances in the mind.

Once the mind is able to remain calm, clear, and boundless, everything is fresh and new in our experience. When we remain in Pristine Mind, all forms we see, all sounds we hear, all tastes, all sensory experiences, take on that fresh, sublime quality. After we exercise or do yoga and take a shower, we feel relaxed yet awake. There is a feeling of being present. It is similar, but much more profound, when our mind remains in the pristine state. Everything is vivid, boundless, and clear. We are refreshed on every level. Thoughts, emotions, and habits get old. Beliefs get stale. But when we remain in Pristine Mind, everything we experience has that same new, fresh, energized quality.

When we remain in that clear state, there are no judgments, there are no labels, there is no place to create and focus on negative experiences. The only thing to do is to maintain present awareness. Then everything we experience takes on that tone.

Once we learn to remain in Pristine Mind in our meditation session, then that pristine quality extends to our whole experience, our whole world. Thus, the reason we meditate is not to experience Pristine Mind only during formal meditation, but to have that experience carry over after meditation. Our experience will gradually carry over so that at all times we can access that fresh, clear experience—even when we are not meditating.

......

### A boundless Experience

In Pristine Mind meditation, there is nothing to meditate on. Simply allow your awareness to be present. Allow your awareness to be free. Notice your awareness.

The most important component of meditation is to get comfortable being in the present moment. We are not paying attention to the breath or sensations or any other object.

Do not make the scope of your meditation too narrow. Do not try to force your mind or your visual focus to stay in one spot or in one particular place. Physically we can be very still, but mentally we might be entirely lost. Our awareness itself is the critical thing we are trying to abide in and become familiar with. We are simply hanging out with our pristine awareness and getting to know it more and more.

After meditating properly for ten to twenty minutes, we feel the boundlessness of our mind, at which point we simply maintain that experience. We do nothing but remain there. When we look out across that meditation experience, there is nothing to focus on. Allow your awareness to remain naked and free. Maintaining that state is meditation. Become comfortable and familiar with that meditation. We are not forcefully trying to do something. If there is effort involved in meditation, then it is awkward and uncomfortable. This meditation should actually feel effortless. It is a relaxed yet alert experience, spending time with our pristine awareness.

After we gain some experience doing this meditation, time starts to go by very quickly whenever we are meditating. It flies by. It feels as if we can continue indefinitely and that we want to keep going. We feel like staying there and not coming back out of our meditation. In meditation, when we feel like we want to remain in meditation, it is extremely positive. When we get to that point, it is a very good sign.



# Do Nothing (Shinzen Young)


## 1st Set of Instructions by Shinzen Young

*The following text is an excerpt from [Five ways to Know yourself](https://www.shinzen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/FiveWaystoKnowYourself_ver1.6.pdf) by Shinzen Young.*

### Introduction

Do Nothing is an approach to rest that involves little or no effort. You don't even have to intentionally note restful states. It is totally passive and easy going.
This approach has been discovered and re-discovered many times and in many places, so it is known by many different historical names. Here are a few:

• Choiceless Awareness (term used by Krishnamurti and others);

• Open Presence (term used by neuroscientists);

• Just Sitting (according to some definitions of that phrase);

• Dzogchen/Mahamudra (in Tibet);

• Passive Contemplation (in Christianity); and 

• Non-dual Awareness (according to some definitions of that phrase).

Do Nothing could also be called “The Technique of No Technique.” Because this sounds a bit selfcontradictory, you might suspect that there are a few subtle points involved in the instructions. Indeed, that is so.
Let's start with the basic instructions (which are quite short). Then we can clarify the subtleties.

### Basic Instructions

1. Let whatever happens, happen.

2. Whenever you're aware of an intention to control your attention, drop that intention.

Now for the subtle points. There are two sides to understanding those subtleties. First, you need to understand what the instruction requires. (Yes, there is a very small amount of doing in Do Nothing. :-) ) Second, you need to understand what the instruction does not require (but what you might think it requires and thus make something that's easy into something that's hard).
Let's start with the phrase “intention to control your attention.”
Sometimes your attention may be drawn to an experience spontaneously without control. The experience just happens. At other times, you may find yourself intentionally controlling the direction or content of your experience, trying to keep it on a certain thing or pull it away from some other thing. This is true of all sensory experience including thoughts (recall: in Basic Mindfulness, thought is defined as mental image, mental talk, or both simultaneously). Sometimes a thought just arises on its own. At other times, you may find yourself intentionally thinking about a topic, intentionally pulling away from a topic, or actively directing a thought after it has arisen spontaneously.
During a period of Do Nothing practice, if you notice that you're intentionally directing your awareness, you drop the intention to do so. You do this whether that intentional direction involves an objective arising (such as sights, sounds, physical body sensations), a subjective arising (such as mental images, mental talk, or emotional body sensations), a restful state, or a flow state.
Notice that what you've been asked to drop is the intention to direct awareness. You're not being asked to drop the thing that you happen to be aware of. So if a thought comes up spontaneously, you don't have to drop that thought. But when you find yourself controlling that thought, drop that intention to control. Do Nothing never asks you to drop experiences. It only asks you to drop intentionally directing how your attention moves within experiences. And you only have to drop an intention when you happen to notice the presence of an intention, which may or may not be very often. So, when you Do Nothing, you may have a lot of sensory activity and you may go unconscious and get caught up in things quite a bit. That's okay! Whenever you notice an intention to do anything about all of that, drop that intention.
But what exactly does it mean to “drop” an intention? It means to let go of that intention in that moment. So, dropping is not the same as getting rid of. The intention might immediately reappear over and over. That's perfectly fine.
But what if you cannot drop it for even a moment? Then you don't have to! Here's why. We're going to define intention within this context to mean something that is totally voluntary. If you cannot drop it for even a moment, then, by our definition, it is not really part of your free will. It's happening to you and you don't need to drop it.
Notice also that the instructions do not ask you to continuously check for whether you're intentionally controlling your awareness or not. To continuously check for the presence or absence of such intention would itself create a continuous intention! When you Do Nothing you may notice intention to control your awareness frequently, occasionally, or hardly ever. Any of these possibilities is fine.
As you can see, anyone can do the Do Nothing technique “perfectly” because its goals are extremely modest. Of course, doing the technique perfectly does not mean that your experience of it will be pleasant, restful, or productive. That's quite a different issue. A “perfect” period of Do Nothing practice may be essentially indistinguishable from a perfect storm of Monkey Mind.
So, what to do when Do Nothing does nothing for you? Do something else! Basic Mindfulness gives you almost two dozen other focus options.

A general principle is:


• If Do Nothing makes you too spacey, try Noting for a while.

• If Noting makes you too racy, try Do Nothing for a while.

Now you can appreciate the initial phrase in the instructions: “Let whatever happens happen.” With this technique, there is no attempt to achieve any particular effect. If the Do Nothing approach happens to work for you at a given time, pursue it; if it doesn't, don't.

## 2nd Set of Instructions by Shinzen Young

*The following text is the transcript of ["Do Nothing" Meditation - Shinzen Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA) by Shinzen Young.*

[0:00] [caption] "Do Nothing" 

[0:05] A lot of the techniques that I give you – the noting techniques and so forth – they require a certain amount of effort. It's good to be able to drop effort also. The techniques I give you involve a certain amount of making decisions. Even moment by moment, when you're doing a noting, if more than one phenomenon is available, you have to sort of choose, and also you choose what approaches you're working on. 

[0:46] It's also good to have a practice that involves no choices whatsoever – not even a choice as to directing what's happening in attention. Some people call this choiceless awareness; some people call it just sitting; some people call it the great perfection (in Tibetan: Dzogchen); or the grand symbol (in Sanskrit: Mahamudra). There's different ways of describing it. I like to call it Do Nothing – that's just my name for it. 

[1:38] There is a way to Do Nothing – a conceptual framework. Needless to say, because the verb 'do' and 'nothing' don't go together, there are some subtleties as to what this all refers to. The Do Nothing technique is designed with time – (I cannot overemphasize that phrase – with time; not when you practice it at a given occasion, but with time) – it is designed to create a sensitivity for a certain circuit in human consciousness – the circuit that controls attention – and it sets up an environment wherein that circuit will turn itself off for a while. [2:47] If you try to turn it off, obviously that's not going to exactly work because you have to keep it on in order to try to turn it off. The Do Nothing technique doesn't involve your hand turning off yourself. It sets up a situation where nature will grow that hand, reach around, and turn off the robot-self for a brief period of time. At some point you and the world will come back so nothing bad at all will happen; you don't have to be afraid. 

[3:33] So that's one way to look at the Do Nothing technique. With time, it will set the stage; you'll develop a sensitivity for the part of you that controls attention (and that's a very, very primitive part of our being); and then, once that sensitivity is developed, it will, for periods of time, turn off. 

[4:02] A lot of people report when I ask them about their experience in practice – 'I can't decide what to do [at] certain times. I'm just confused with all the options.' That's a really good experience. I know you think it's a bad experience, but actually that's a good experience, because when you're sort of like – 'I don't know what to do with my meditation right now' – the part that controls attention is maximally activated at that time. That's the thing that's going to turn off through the Do Nothing technique. But when it's maximally activated, it's good to know because that points you to – 'Oh, that's the place.' This sort of, 'I don't know what to do, and I should be able to figure out what to do next' – whenever that confusion about what should I do with the practice arises, that's a strong arising from the place of choice. That's good, because for a moment your attention is adverted to the place of choice. Love that. Maybe that wouldn't be a bad time to Do Nothing. 

[5:20] The instruction set for how to Do Nothing is very short – just two sentences: Let whatever happens happen. As soon as you're aware of an intention to control your attention, drop that intention. 

[5:40] Let's go through the inevitable subtleties, the inevitable confusions. There's nothing in this technique that says that you should maintain an intention to drop intentions. It says, 'When you are aware of an intention to control your attention, drop that intention.' You might think that the technique is saying, 'Moment-by-moment monitor whether you have an intention or not, and always maintain the intention to drop those intentions.' Well then you'd be doing two things instead of doing nothing. 

[6:27] 'Let whatever happens happen' means whatever sensory experiences are going to happen, let them happen, including that you may be very scattered, maybe that you may get sleepy and go unconscious, that you may get lost in monkey mind for long periods of time, that you will have very little concentration, clarity or equanimity. Those are some of the things that could happen. They come under the phrase, 'Let whatever happens happen.' So there's nothing in this technique that says those things won't happen, and they may be all that happens. However, it also says, 'As soon as you're aware of the intention to control your attention' – so, if you have an intention to do something about anything that has happened – drop that intention. 

[7:34] Inevitable question: 'What happens if I can't drop it?' Well, that goes to needing clarification about what 'drop' means and what 'intention' means. The phraseology has been extremely carefully developed: 'Whenever you're aware of the intention to control your attention, drop that intention.' 

[8:00] We're going to define 'intention' in a very specific way, and we're going to define 'drop' in a very specific way. 'Intention' is something that, by definition, you have complete control over. You can initiate it, or you can drop it. I have complete control over the movement of my arm. I can raise it, and I can decide not to raise it. 

[8:30] 'Drop' does not mean get 'rid of'. It's in the moment: you drop the intention; the intention might come back immediately. That's fine. When it comes back, drop it again. If you can't drop it for even a second, then it's not fully free will – it's not full intention, so you don't have to drop it. Anything that you might think is an intention to control your attention, that, when you drop it, you simply can't, then actually that's not free will – it's happening to you, and if you can't drop the intention, you don't have to drop it because the technique doesn't ask you to do that, and certainly the technique does not ask you to have a restful experience, although that could be a consequence of the technique and, with time, tends to be a consequence of the technique. If the experience is horribly agitating and uncomfortable, there's absolutely no reason why you need to continue with this technique at that time. The catch phrase that I use is, 'If noting makes you racy, try Do Nothing. If Do Nothing makes you spacey, try noting.' 

[9:53] Notice the phrase, 'As soon as you're aware of...' You may very seldom be aware of the intention to control your attention. That's perfectly okay; I didn't say you'd be aware of it very often. Specifically, you are not being asked to moment-by-moment monitor for the presence of that intention. You have to wait for the awareness to be there, which might not be much of a wait, or it might be a long wait while you're lost in reverie and sleepiness. Perfectly okay, as far as this technique goes. [10:36] This is gomeh. Last night, I gave a Tibetan word – dacmeh. I said meh means without; dac means self. Gom is the Tibetan word for meditate. Gomeh means 'don't meditate'. Of course, you are meditating though. The true gomeh would be the state of 99.9% of human beings all the time. They truly don't meditate. This is a form of meditation, but it's a sort of anti-meditation meditation. So, as soon as you're aware of that intention, then drop it, whenever that may be, which may not be very often. 

[11:32] There's no noting or labeling involved, obviously. 

[11:36] Common question: 'What if I have the intention to move my body?' Well... that's okay. I wouldn't always give in to it, but what you're pinpointing with this technique is most specifically whatever it is within us that decides to initiate thoughts, attempts to suppress thoughts, attempts to direct thoughts, decides to pursue a thought once it arises, or take it in some other direction once it arises, or use thought to do something about thought. That sort of place within us – whatever that place is – is what this technique will pinpoint with time. 

[12:36] There are automatic responses of concentration, clarity and equanimity within meditators. You don't have to have an intention for those to occur. They occur automatically. You don't drop that, because you'd actually have to have an intention to stop an automatic meditator's response. So you absolutely do not interfere with the momentum of concentration, clarity and equanimity that you've developed with the other techniques. In fact, that's sort of the whole idea. If there's any meditation that occurs in this technique, it's because of all the meditation you've done before is meditating you. You're not meditating. 

[13:40] So two things are meditating you: the momentum of your previous practice and – whatever you want to call it – the nature of nature, spirit, time, God, God's grace – choose your words. I repeat, you're not meditating, but two things are meditating you: the momentum of what you've done previously and whatever you want to call this other thing. 

[14:27] Someday we won't have to use this technique. We'll have a complete circuitry diagram of the human central nervous system that will be extremely complex – to put it mildly – but we'll probably be able to point to that circuit and probably be able to, from the outside, turn it off for a little while, perhaps inducing at will experiences of freedom from limited identity.
